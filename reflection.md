- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
it represents a parent super hero class and you can extend it to create any super hero you want!
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
 I did not implement additional methods but I added a lot of a attributes so I can miss around with the methods we have 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I enjoyed this assignment and I want to work more on it. I have a lot of ideas and methods to implement and I will work on doing that.. coming to office hours was helpful and I would advice them to do that.
